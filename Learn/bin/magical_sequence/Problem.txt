Magical Sequence
Youâ€™re given a sequence of digits. Find the count of all contiguous subsequences that make a magical sequence. A magical sequence passes the following test:

From the last digit, and moving left, double the value of every alternate digit. If the result of this operation is two digit number, then add the digits (e.g., 18: 1 + 8 = 9).

Sum up all the digits.

Resultant sum is divisible by 10.

Input Format
The first line of input consists of an integer t denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the length of the sequence d. This is followed by a sequence containing d digits.

Output Format
For each case output the count of all magical sequences.

Constraints
1 <= t <= 1000

1 <= d <= 1000
