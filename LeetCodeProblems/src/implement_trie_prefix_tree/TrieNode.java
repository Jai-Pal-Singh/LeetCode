 * Trie node structure
Trie is a rooted tree. Its nodes have the following fields:

Maximum of RR links to its children, where each link corresponds to one of RR character values from dataset alphabet. In this article we assume that RR is 26, the number of lowercase latin letters.
Boolean field which specifies whether the node corresponds to the end of the key, or is just a key prefix.
