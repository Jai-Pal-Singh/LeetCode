package remove_k_digits;

/**
 * Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= num.length <= 105
num consists of only digits.
num does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

/**
 * The first algorithm is straight-forward. Let's think about the simplest case: how to remove 1 digit from the number so that the new number is the smallest possibleï¼Ÿ Well, one can simply scan from left to right, and remove the first "peak" digit; the peak digit is larger than its right neighbor. One can repeat this procedure k times, and obtain the first algorithm:
