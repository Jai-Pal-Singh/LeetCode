/**
 * Given a rectangle of size n x m, return the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the rectangle.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 2, m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 squares are necessary to cover the rectangle.
2 (squares of 1x1)
1 (square of 2x2)
Example 2:



Input: n = 5, m = 8
Output: 5
Example 3:



Input: n = 11, m = 13
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 13

 /**
  * 
    tilingRectangle is a function which tries to split the rectangle at some position. The function is called recursively for both parts. Try all possible splits and take the one with minimum result. The base case is when both sides are equal i.e the input is already a square, in which case the result is We are trying to find the cut which is nearest to the center which will lead us to our minimum result. 

Assuming we have a rectangle with width is N and height is M. 

if (N == M), so it is a square and nothing need to be done.
Otherwise, we can divide the rectangle into two other smaller one (N – x, M) and (x, M), so it can be solved recursively.
Similarly, we can also divide it into (N, M – x) and (N, x)
Also we need to be aware of an edge case here which is N=11 and M=13 or vice versa.
